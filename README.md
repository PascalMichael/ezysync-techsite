# EzySync Technologies Ltd — Next.js Website (Preview)

This is a ready-to-deploy **Next.js (App Router)** project scaffold for EzySync Technologies Ltd.
It includes Home, Services, About, Photos, and Contact pages, TailwindCSS setup, and an EmailJS-ready contact form.

## Quick start (locally)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. EmailJS

- Create an EmailJS account and template (template id `contact_form` recommended).
- Replace placeholders in `app/contact/page.tsx` with your Service ID and Public Key.

4. Deploy

- Push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel (one-click).

## Notes
- Images in `public/photos` are placeholders — replace with your own photos.
- Tailwind config is minimal; adjust design tokens as needed.
